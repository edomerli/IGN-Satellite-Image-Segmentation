Repository of the project for the exam Deep Learning of the University of Bologna, July 2023

**Problem**: Segmentation task on the [IGN FLAIR 1 Dataset](https://ignf.github.io/FLAIR/), with the objective of maximizing Dice coefficient

**Proposed solution**: Implemented a DRUNET Model as described in the paper [DRUNET: A Dilated-Residual U-Net Deep Learning Network to Digitally Stain Optic Nerve Head Tissues in Optical Coherence Tomography Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00232)

**Results**: the model achieved a validation Dice coefficient value of **0.59**
